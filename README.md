# MicroServicesProject_1

# This is a microservices project based on NodeJS and React

# Notes: 
1. DB per service: each micro service should have their own DB if needed

  1.1 Communications strategies between two services: Sync and Async (Not the ones mean in the JavaScript world)
    1.1.1 Sync means services communicate with each other using direct requests, while Async means services communicate with each other using events
    
 # This is a simple sample project - a blog that can handle users' posts and comments, but using microservices
